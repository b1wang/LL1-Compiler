Current bugs:

- While loops, when new phi is added and will loop downwards to modify all instructions, does not work properly
    - Problem: In the ChangeAllSymbols function
    - Need to find a way to track which variables are invariant

    - Subproblems:
        - Because it looks back around to change "all symbols", it messes up anything within the while loop 
            - Bugs in nested while loop
            - Bugs in a if in while loop
